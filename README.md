##  Available Scripts

In the project folder, you can run the following:

###  `npm start`
Runs the app in **development mode**.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.  

- The page **reloads** if you edit the code  
- Errors will show in the console  

---

###  `npm test`
Runs the test runner in **watch mode**.  
More info: [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

---

###  `npm run build`
Creates a **production build** in the `build` folder.  

- React runs in **production mode**  
- Build is **optimized** and **minified**  
- Filenames include **hashes** (good for caching)  

Your app is ready to be deployed  
More info: [Deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)

---

###  `npm run eject`
**Note: This cannot be undone!**  

`eject` copies all the configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, allowing you to customize them.  
As a student, you don’t usually need this — the default setup works fine for most projects.

✨ Just a simple React app for learning and experimenting!
